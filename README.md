WHY
----

The problem
-----------

* Communication between members withing certain co-working space is the ultimate thing (it is highly engaging, educative and is immediate).
* Other communication tools for co-working world (like Skype, Facebook, Dropbox) are disconnected, too general and frustrating.   
* Co-working web pages don't provide a central space for their members to simply connect, share and work with other community members. 
* Existing communication tools don't manage to connect all the members around one camp fire. You have to find and to arrange contacts yourself. And you have to use platforms you share with friends and family.


The Solution
--------------

* People log in to Co-Office
* They can pin a message on a Co-office Pinboard and chat with other members.
* If you are busy, you mark yourself as busy so others can't interrupt you.
* If you are interupptable, people can click you (and others) to start an instant (group) chat.
* Chat feature enables you asynchronous communication and sharing resouces.
* It is open-source, so you can tweak it to work best for your requirements.

The impact
----------
* Co-working members no longer need to search and connect with their colleagues through different platforms
* Instead they can join virtual office, which is just as good, if not better, than the real office.
